At this stage I would go back to features. Possible ways for improvement: some of the features from districts table are correlated, maybe it would be better to remove some of them. Transactions table is not fully used, there are much more possible features that could be derived, e.g. amount / count / std of transactions, grouped by not only TYPE, but also OPERATION. There are even examples of using time-frequency features, which we could potentially derive thank to DATE column. For sake of completeness I'll check performance on test data."
